### Quality Summary
The function is simple and achieves its intended purpose of printing out a greeting. However, it lacks flexibility and does not handle potential errors.

### Line-specific Comments
1. `def greet(name):` 
   * Consider adding a docstring to describe the function's purpose and parameters.
2. `print("Hello " + name + "!")` 
   * This line uses string concatenation, which can be less readable than f-strings for more complex strings.
   * There is no input validation, so the function may not behave as expected if `name` is not a string.
   * The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur during execution.

### Quality Rating
**Needs Improvement**

The function is straightforward but lacks error handling and input validation. It could also be improved with the use of more modern Python features such as f-strings. A better version of the function might look like this:
```python
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    """
    Prints out a personalized greeting.
    
    Args:
    name (str): The name to include in the greeting.
    """
    try:
        print(f"Hello {name}!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

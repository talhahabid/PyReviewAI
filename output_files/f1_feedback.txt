### Quality Summary
The given function is concise and effectively calculates the average of a list of numbers. However, it may not handle certain edge cases as expected (e.g., non-numeric values, division by zero).

### Line-Specific Comments
1. `if not numbers: return 0` 
   - Consider raising a `ValueError` or returning `None` instead of 0 to indicate that the input list is empty. Returning 0 might be misleading, as it's a valid average value for a list of numbers.

2. `return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`
   - This line assumes that the input list only contains numeric values. If the list contains non-numeric values, a `TypeError` will be raised.
   - Additionally, if the input list is very large and contains very large numbers, the sum might exceed the maximum limit for an integer in Python, leading to an `OverflowError`.

### Quality Rating
Needs Improvement

To improve the function, consider adding error checking code to handle potential issues, such as:
- Checking if the input is a list
- Verifying that the list contains only numeric values
- Handling the case where the input list contains extremely large numbers

Here is an updated version of the function:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not isinstance(numbers, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in numbers):
        raise ValueError("All elements in the list must be numbers")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

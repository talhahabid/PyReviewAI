### Brief Quality Summary
The function is straightforward and achieves its purpose, but there are areas for improvement in terms of Pythonic coding style, variable naming, and handling potential edge cases.

### Line-specific Comments
1. `def find_max(nums):` 
   * Consider using a more descriptive function name, such as `find_maximum_number`.
   * The parameter name `nums` could be more descriptive, e.g., `numbers`.

2. `max = 0` 
   * This initializes `max` to 0, which assumes that all numbers in the list are positive. If there are only negative numbers, this will return an incorrect result. 
   * Consider initializing `max` to the first element of `nums` or using the `float('-inf')` to handle negative numbers and empty lists.

3. `for num in nums:` 
   * This loop is clear and effective for its purpose.

4. `if num > max:` 
   * This condition is correct for updating `max`, but consider using `elif` or a try-except block to handle potential edge cases.

5. `return max` 
   * This return statement is clear, but consider adding a docstring or comment to explain what the function returns.

### Quality Rating
Needs Improvement

This rating is due to the potential issues with handling negative numbers, empty lists, and the lack of documentation. The function could be improved by addressing these areas and using more Pythonic coding practices.

### Example of Improved Version
```python
def find_maximum_number(numbers):
    """
    Find the maximum number in a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        The maximum number in the list. If the list is empty, returns None.
    """
    if not numbers:
        return None
    max_num = float('-inf')
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num
```
Alternatively, you could use the built-in `max()` function, which is more Pythonic and efficient:
```python
def find_maximum_number(numbers):
    """
    Find the maximum number in a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        The maximum number in the list. If the list is empty, returns None.
    """
    return max(numbers) if numbers else None
```
